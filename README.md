## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/irahrosete/toy_app
$ cd toy_app
```

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ yarn install --check-files
$ bundle install
```

(If you run into any installation issues or missing dependencies, refer to the [first chapter](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition-tutorial/beginning) of the tutorial for details.)

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, youâ€™ll be ready to seed the database with sample users and run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails db:seed
$ rails server
```
