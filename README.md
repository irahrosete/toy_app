This is the application from
[Ruby on Rails Tutorial:

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:
`$ git clone https://github.com/irahrosete/toy_app`
`$ cd toy_app`

Then install the needed packages:
`$ bundle install`
`$ yarn install --check-files`

(If you run into any installation issues or missing dependencies, refer to the [first chapter](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition-tutorial/beginning) of the tutorial for details.)

Next, migrate the database:
`$ rails db:migrate`

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
`$ rails test`

If the test suite passes, youâ€™ll be ready to seed the database with sample users and run the app in a local server:
`$ rails db:seed`
`$ rails server`
